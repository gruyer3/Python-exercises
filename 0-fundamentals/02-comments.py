# Single line comments can be created by using hashtag (#) symbol. 
# They're best for explaining why, adding TODO/FIXME markers or temporarily disabling code.
# Example of single line comment:
error_code = 0 # Initializing error counter
# TODO: handle case when argument is None
# Focus on commenting more complex lines

"""
It is possible to wrap multiline comments between triple single-quotes or between triple double quotes.
